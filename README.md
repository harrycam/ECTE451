# ECTE451 Thesis: Supervised Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning For Student Learning

This repository contains the code used for my ECTE451 thesis investigating the use of Supervised Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning For Student Learning in training a Autonomous Robot Navigation controller.

The main file to be run for the RL portion of the thesis is: https://github.com/harrycam/ECTE451/blob/main/createRobotAgent.m

Pretrained actor networks are provided as part of this repository. ActorSupervised.mat is a NN structure with 32 neurons per hidden layer, ActorSupervised2.mat (used in thesis) is a NN structure with 16 neurons per hidden layer.
